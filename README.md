# GoTemplate

## Description
GoTemplate is a Golang project template with a PostgreSQL database. It includes a command-line tool (CLI) and a gRPC server for managing user operations. The project follows a hexagonal architecture and utilizes NATS for notifications.

## Architecture
This project is designed following the **Clean Architecture** pattern, ensuring a decoupled, maintainable, and testable codebase. Clean Architecture organizes the application into distinct layers, each with explicit dependencies pointing inwards. This structure ensures that the core business logic remains independent of external systems, such as databases, frameworks, or user interfaces.

- **PostgreSQL**: Used as the primary database.
- **NATS**: Used for asynchronous messaging and notifications.
- **gRPC**: Supports efficient inter-service communication.
- **Cobra**: CLI framework for command-line interactions.
- **Testify**: Used for unit testing.

### Legend

| Symbol | Description |
|:------:|-------------|
| ✅     | Perfect match: all features are supported. Client and server versions have exactly the same features/APIs. |
| 🟠     | Forward compatibility: the client will work with the server, but not all new server features are supported. The server has features that the client library cannot use. |
| ❌     | Backward compatibility/Not applicable: the client has features that may not be present in the server. Common features will work, but some client APIs might not be available in the server. |
| -      | Not tested: this combination has not been verified or is not applicable. |

## Requirements
To run this project, please follow the steps listed below:

### 1. Install Go 1.24
Follow the official [Go installation guide](https://go.dev/doc/install) or use the following commands:

```sh
curl -L -o go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://go.dev/dl/go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm go1.24.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
Add the Go binary path to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):
```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

### 2. Install GolangCI-Lint
A linter for Go projects, more info please refer to [GolangCI-Lint](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/):
```sh
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/HEAD/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.64.6
```

### 3. Install Docker & Docker Compose
Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed:
- [Docker Installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

make lint   # Run Golangci-Lint, Goimports and Gofmt
make test   # Run unit and integration tests
make mocks  # Generate mock implementations
make proto  # Generate gRPC code
```

## API Endpoints
### **1. Create a User**
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/users \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "first_name": "Alice",
        "last_name": "Bob",
        "nickname": "AB123",
        "email": "alice@bob.com",
        "country": "UK"
    }'
```

### **2. Retrieve a User by ID**

```

## Running in Docker
### **Start Services**
```sh
make server
```
This starts the following services:
- PostgreSQL (database)
- NATS (message broker)
- GoTemplate (application server)

### **Stopping Services**
```sh
make purge
```
This stops and removes all running services (includind containers, volumes, images and networks).

### **Accessing the app container**
```sh
make attach
```

### Logging
To view logs, use the following command:
```sh
make logs
```

### Command Line Interface (CLI)
The CLI is used for managing user operations. To run the CLI, use the following command:
